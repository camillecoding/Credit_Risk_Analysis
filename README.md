# Credit Risk Analysis
This project relies on a few methods of Machine Learning to determine which, if any, method exhibits the least amount of bias in determining customer credit risk.

## Analysis ##
Below I have analyzed the results of my project.

### Overview ###
It is important for lending institutions to examine the full profile of a potential borrower so that they can determine whether to lend, and if so, what a reasonable interest rate will be. There have been insidious cases where human or computer bias keeps some borrowers out of the market entirely and subjects others to unfairly high interest rates based on their demographics. My project aims to identify any machine learning biases so understand which method will provide the most accurate and fair results. I tested 6 machine learning models in this project.
